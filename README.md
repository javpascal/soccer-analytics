## Soccer Analytics

A repository for storing any work I do in soccer analytics. Outside of the notebooks, I plan to do a lot of work in Tableau.

### Notebooks

### Tableau Workbooks

* [Brazilian Serie A 2015: Age Distribution and Minutes Up to Matchday 9](https://public.tableau.com/profile/gordonf#!/vizhome/BrazilianSerieA2015_Players_Matchday9/Dashboard1)
